# Systems & Network Security {#systemsnetworksec}

## Purpose of Policy
The purpose of this Policy is to establish requirements for the protection of Mill Creek’s information assets from cybersecurity threats which could compromise Mill Creek’s confidential and sensitive data and to ensure secure, reliable network access.

### Policy Scope
This Policy covers all Mill Creek cybersecurity practices across all areas of its business.  All Mill Creek employees, including contractors, third parties and anyone with access to Mill Creek’s data and related assets, are required to comply with this Policy.

## Endpoint Protection Policy
- Anti-virus/Anti-malware Protection: Mill Creek will ensure its computing systems implement the following fundamental security controls and practices, including but not limited to:
- Password requirements, including Multi-Factor Authorization (MFA) for remote connections.
- Virus protection.
- Personal firewalls.
- Automatic updates enabled for security updates.
- Protect information assets by taking active measures to detect, prevent, and manage malware and virus intrusions and recover from their effects.
- Anti-virus and anti-spyware will be installed on all of Mill Creek’s computing systems. 
- A network-based malware detection solution will be used as a compensating control when management recommends not installing anti-virus and anti-malware software on its computing devices.
- Scans of systems to identify and remove unauthorized software will be conducted periodically.
- Anti-malware and anti-spyware will be configured to automatically scan for downloads, email attachments, and browser usage.
- Anti-malware and anti-spyware alerts and logging will be enabled.

## Automatic Updates/Patching
- All systems connected to Mill Creek’s network will have the latest security patches available from the respective vendors and such security patches will be applied with system security updates set to install automatically. 
- If security patches are unable to be installed due to business compatibility issues, Mill Creek will implement mitigating and/or compensating controls, appropriate to address the vulnerability. 

## Disk Encryption
- Mill Creek’s desktops, servers, and mobile devices will employ full disk encryption with an approved software encryption package.

## Network Security

### Host-based/Personal Firewall
- All Mill Creek computers or computers connected to the Mill Creek network will run a personal firewall with the firewall enabled. 

### Network-based Firewall/Firewall Router Device 
- Mill Creek shall ensure that all external and wireless connections to Mill Creek’s networks will pass through a network firewall.
- Mill Creek’s firewall rules will restrict inbound and outbound traffic to external or trusted networks.
- Mill Creek shall change all vendor default settings for network-based firewalls (e.g., passwords, wireless encryption keys, Simple Network Management Protocol community strings) will be changed prior to installing equipment in a production environment.
- Mill Creek’s firewall rules shall apply a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except traffic that is authorized.
- Mill Creek shall adequately test any change to an external connection to the configuration of the firewall, and personnel authorized by Mill Creek shall document and approve such change.
- Mill Creek shall physically place network-based firewalls within a secure space accessible only to those whose roles and responsibilities permit them to manage the firewall.
- Mill Creek shall ensure network-based firewalls will be configured by a secure, encrypted connection with access restricted only to those whose roles and responsibilities permit them to manage the firewall.
- Mill Creek shall periodically back up network-based firewall configurations and store backups securely and accessible to only authorized personnel.

### Wireless Networking
- Wireless networks will be segmented between external guests and internal networks.
- Non-Mill Creek devices are prohibited from connecting to Mill Creek’s internal network.
- Users inside the Mill Creek firewall will not connect to the internal network if they are using a bridged wireless connection to connect to an external network.
- Wireless access points or routing devices with wireless capability are not allowed unless approved by the Senior Officer.
- Logical and physical user access to wireless network devices will be restricted to authorized personnel.
- Perimeter firewalls will be implemented and configured to restrict unauthorized access.
- All vendor default settings for wireless devices (e.g., passwords, wireless encryption keys, Simple Network Management Protocol community strings) will be changed prior to installing wireless equipment in a production environment.
- Mill Creek will use wireless security protocols that are of the highest encryption possible.
- Mill Creek will require the use of strong passwords for setting encryption for all wireless SSID and will require passwords to be changed periodically (e.g., every 3 months).
- Wireless device audits will be conducted periodically to determine if any rogue devices exist on the Mill Creek network.
- Findings from wireless device audits will be presented as soon as possible to the Senior Officer and all rogue devices will be documented and removed from the network.
- Wireless routers and access points configurations will be backed up periodically and stored securely with access to the configurations restricted to authorized personnel.

### Email Security
- Anti-Spam and anti-phishing software will be installed and implemented at entry/exit points of the network and on computing devices connected to the Mill Creek network.
- Anti-Spam and anti-phishing software will be updated to new releases to ensure Mill Creek is protected from the latest email threats.
- All Mill Creek employees and contractors will attend a phishing awareness and training program at least twice a year.
- Mill Creek will require strong authentication measures, including MFA, for access to cloud email such as Office 365 or Gmail in order to reduce account takeover risk.

### Monitoring and Auditing
- Mill Creek will maintain and monitor system and network traffic logs for all network devices and systems for security auditing purposes and legal and regulatory requirements.
- Access to log management systems will be recorded and limited to authorized individuals with a specific need for such access. 
- For a period of no fewer than 3 years, Mill Creek will securely maintain systems audit trails designed to detect and respond to cybersecurity events that have a reasonable likelihood of materially harming any material part of the normal business operations.
- Mill Creek will reserve the right to monitor, access, retrieve, read, and/or disclose data communications when there is reasonable cause to suspect a policy violation, potential criminal activity, monitoring required by law enforcement, or an appropriate management request.
