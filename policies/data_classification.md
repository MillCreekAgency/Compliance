# Data Classification {#dataclassification}

## Purpose of Policy

This Policy establishes a framework for identifying, classifying, and securing confidential and sensitive corporate and consumer data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Nonpublic Information (NPI), and Electronic Health Information (ePHI).  Mill Creek will classify its data based on its sensitivity, value, and criticality and secure such data appropriately based on its classification.

### Policy Scope
This Policy applies to any form of digital data stored on any media used by Mill Creek employees, as well as contractors, consultants, third parties, Third Party Service Providers, and anyone else authorized to access Mill Creek’s data.

## Roles and Responsibilities

The Senior Officer responsible for Mill Creek’s cybersecurity:

- Will work with key stakeholders to ensure Mill Creek’s data is reviewed and categorized.
- Will ensure data classification labels are assigned based on data sensitivity and criticality (see data classification table).  Mill Creek’s data classifications are:
  - High – Restricted
  - Medium – Confidential
  - Low – Public
- Will ensure that data merged or compiled from multiple classification sources is classified at the most secure classification level.
- Will ensure that data containing information with High and Medium classifications is secured pursuant to federal and/or state regulations and guidelines that pertain to Mill Creek.
- Will ensure a set of proper access controls designed to protect each data classification label is implemented and, if feasible, monitored and audited.
- Will ensure regular backups are performed and backups sets are protected.
- Will ensure data classified at Medium or High is encrypted while such data is at rest, in storage, or in-transit, and access logs regarding such information are monitored and reviewed periodically.
- Will ensure the appropriate disposal of data when information is no longer needed or in use.

## Data Users

- Will only transfer files between network drives on Mill Creek’s internal network. (Mill Creek’s email system may not be designed to support the transmission of sensitive data securely.) 
- Will secure restricted and confidential data sent or received electronically by not leaving such information in public view and, if possible, by using encryption technology such as a secure web transfer or the Secure File Transfer Protocol. 
- Will use data in a manner that is consistent with the purpose intended and comply with all Mill Creek policies applicable to data use.
- Will only share data with those who need to know, and are authorized to use, the information in that data.

**With respect to Third Parties**:

- Mill Creek will undertake a security review of each Third Party Service Provider (TPSP) that will have access to Mill Creek’s data, including an assessment of their security controls, before routinely exchanging data classified as Medium or Low with them. 
- Mill Creek will ensure the security of Mill Creek’s Information Systems and NPI that are accessible to, or held by, TPSPs.
- Mill Creek will use appropriate measures to ensure that contracts with TPSPs identify which party will be responsible for securing sensitive data in transit, how Mill Creek’s data will be secured, and how any specific confidentiality and regulatory obligations will be handled.
