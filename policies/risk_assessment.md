# Risk Assessment {#riskassessment}

## Purpose of Policy

The purpose of this Policy is to provide a framework for identifying cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities so that Mill Creek can implement comprehensive solutions to address those risks and vulnerabilities.  A Risk Assessment will ensure Mill Creek is aware of, and can adequately protect itself from, new risks and vulnerabilities that constantly arise with respect to cybersecurity, and to ensure Mill Creek’s data and other related assets are protected to the greatest extent possible.

To that end, Mill Creek will conduct a Risk Assessment of its Information Systems which will inform the design of its Cybersecurity Program. Mill Creek will conduct Risk Assessments periodically and update its Risk Assessment as necessary to address changes to Mill Creek’s Information Systems, Non-Public Information (NPI), or business operations. Mill Creek’s Risk Assessment will be conducted in accordance with this Policy.

### Policy Scope
This Policy covers all Mill Creek activities across all areas of its business.  It applies to all employees, including contractors, service providers and anyone with access to Mill Creek’s data and related assets.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Mill Creek leadership will establish criteria for:
- Evaluating and categorizing cyber risks and threats facing Mill Creek.
- Assessing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Mill Creek Information Systems and its technology assets, including all data and NPI.
- Mitigating or accepting risk identified by the Risk Assessment.
- Evaluating the adequacy of existing controls in the context of identified risks.
- Updating the Risk Assessment at least annually to address new risks resulting from changes to Information Systems, business operations, or new products and services.

## Risk Assessment

The Risk Assessment will assist Mill Creek in understanding, managing, controlling, and mitigating cyber risk by establishing a formal set of guidelines to:
1. Identify and Prioritize Assets.
2. Identify Threats
3. Identify Vulnerability 
4. Determine Likelihood and Impact
5. Determine Inherent Risks 
6. Analyze Controls
7. Determine Control Effectiveness
8. Analyze Residual Risks
9. Document Results


## Identifying and Prioritizing Assets
The process of discovering, recognizing, and documenting assets is the first step in risk identification.  Risk identification is essential because the risk that is identified can be assessed and subjected to appropriate mitigation.  When assets are not identified, management cannot adequately evaluate, prevent, or minimize cyber risk that can damage both Mill Creek and Mill Creek’s customers whose private information may be revealed and/or stolen for illicit purposes.

Mill Creek will create a list of all information assets. Information assets may include tangible items such as servers and workstations and non-tangible digital assets such as sensitive data, NPI and Personally Identifiable Information (PII). For each asset, Mill Creek will compile the following information, as applicable:

- Hardware (such as servers, workstations, firewalls, wireless routers, mobile phones, printers, copiers, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), power generators)
- Software (such as operating systems, firmware, Outlook, Adobe Acrobat)
- Applications (such as Exchange)
- Cloud providers (such as Office 365)

Mill Creek will define a standard for determining the importance of each asset. An overall asset’s monetary value may take into account replacement costs, profitability, and legal or regulatory importance.  Once Mill Creek has defined a standard, it will be formally incorporated into the Risk Assessment process.

## Identify Threats
Threats are anything that could cause harm to an organization. Every Risk Assessment should uncover some basic threats. Additional threats found will depend on the size, type of business, and systems used by an organization. Common threat types include:

- Unauthorized access (malicious or accidental): This could be from a hacking attack/compromise, malware infection, or insider threat.
- Misuse of information (or privilege) by an authorized user: This could result from unapproved use of data or changes to data made without approval.
- Data leakage or unintentional exposure of information: This could result from permitting the use of unencrypted portable storage devices without restriction, inadequate retention and destruction practices, transmitting NPI unsecured, or accidentally sending sensitive information to the wrong recipient.
- Loss of data: This can happen when an organization does not have adequate backup and recovery processes.
- Disruption of service or productivity: This includes the inability to access resources due to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, and pandemics or due to human-made disasters such as hardware failure from outdated hardware or the physical theft of a computer or server, etc.

Mill Creek will identify all possible threats to the security of its information assets and address those threats that have a reasonable likelihood of adversely impacting its business.

## Identify Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness that can enable a threat to harm an organization. Vulnerabilities can be identified through analysis, audit reports, vulnerability assessments, and tabletop exercises.  Examples of threats and corresponding vulnerabilities are:
 
| Threat                                                | Vulnerability                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data leakage or unintentional exposure of information | Unencrypted portable storage with sensitive information was stolen |
| Loss of data                                          | Backups tapes from last week did not complete                      |
| Disruption of service or productivity                 | Pandemic prevents access to office                                 |



Mill Creek will identify all vulnerabilities and address those vulnerabilities that have a reasonable likelihood of adversely impacting its business.

## Likelihood and Impact

Mill Creek will determine the likelihood and impact of all vulnerabilities by assessing the probability that a vulnerability might actually be exploited and the impact that such an exploitation would have on Mill Creek if the asset is compromised, lost or damaged.  Mill Creek will use the categories High (highly probable, with significant economic and reputational damage,), Medium (probable, with moderate impact), and Low (highly unlikely, with minimal impact) to determine the likelihood of an attack or other adverse event.
Inherent Risk 

To have a complete view of risk, Mill Creek will review and consider how to respond in worst-case scenarios should any controls fail.  Inherent risk is the initial risk that exists when an organization has not implemented controls to reduce the likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, or to mitigate a risk event’s severity. 
Factoring inherent risk determines how an organization prioritizes risk response efforts by addressing those risks that significantly impact the organization. Mill Creek will use the categories High, Medium, and Low to determine inherent risk.
Analyze Controls

Cybersecurity controls are the countermeasures that Mill Creek will implement to detect, prevent, reduce, or counteract security risks. They are the measures that a business deploys to manage threats targeting computer systems and networks. Mill Creek will analyze cybersecurity controls to minimize or eliminate the probability that a threat will exploit a vulnerability. 
Controls can either be technical or non-technical.  Non-technical controls are management and operational controls, such as administrative policies, procedures, and standards.  Technical controls are safeguards that are incorporated into computer hardware, software, or firmware. Encryption, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and firewalls are common technical controls.  Mill Creek shall identify controls that will prevent, mitigate, detect, or compensate for addressing an identified vulnerability.

## Determine Control Effectiveness/Residual Risk
Once Mill Creek has identified controls that will prevent, mitigate, detect, or compensate for addressing an identified vulnerability, Mill Creek will assess the control’s effectiveness to determine residual risk. Mill Creek will categorize a control’s effectiveness as Satisfactory, Satisfactory with Recommendations, Needs Improvement, or Inadequate.
A certain amount of Residual Risk will remain in place even after Mill Creek implements security measures and controls. Mill Creek will use the categories High, Medium, and Low to assess the remaining risk once controls have been applied. 

## Document Risk Assessment Results

The final step in the Risk Assessment process is to record results in order to make appropriate decisions with respect to strategic planning, budget, policies, procedures, and other matters. Mill Creek’s recorded results will identify assets and describe the corresponding threats and vulnerabilities to derive risk value representing Mill Creek's inherent risk. Mill Creek’s recorded findings also will identify and assess the effectiveness of the set of controls or control recommendations to determine the residual risk to the organization. 

In conclusion, Risk Assessments are a fundamental part of a risk management process because they help an organization arrive at an acceptable level of risk and draw attention to potential or required control measures. The Risk Assessment process is iterative and must be conducted and reviewed regularly to ensure the Cybersecurity Program’s relevancy.
