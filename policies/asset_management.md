# Asset Device Management {#assestdevicemgmt}

## Purpose of Policy

The purpose of this Policy is to protect and preserve Mill Creeks’ technology assets, and to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Mill Creek’s Information Systems, technological resources, and data.

It is critically important for Mill Creek to know the location and status of all of its computers, devices, and other equipment that can be used to access Mill Creek’s technology assets, Information Systems, and related resources. In order to do so, Mill Creek will maintain up-to-date inventory lists and asset controls.  Lost or stolen equipment often contains sensitive data. Proper asset management procedures and protocols include documenting and supporting recovery and replacement of missing equipment and assets, including documenting and supporting insurance activities related to such equipment and assets. This Policy defines the responsibility of everyone within Mill Creek to ensure asset inventories are current and effective controls are in place to identify, track, manage, and dispose of assets properly.

### Policy Scope

This Policy covers all of Mill Creek’s cybersecurity practices across all areas of its business. All Mill Creek employees, including contractors, third parties, Third Party Service Providers, and anyone else who is in possession of Mill Creek’s equipment and/or assets, are required to comply with this Policy.

- A process to identify unauthorized hardware and/or software will be undertaken periodically and, if any unauthorized hardware or software is discovered, immediate action will be taken to remedy the situation.

- A data destruction protocol will be established and implemented for data destruction.
