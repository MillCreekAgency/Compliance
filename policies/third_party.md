# Third Party Service Providers {#tpsp}

## Purpose of Policy
This Policy shall establish requirements by which Mill Creek will manage security risks associated with Third Party Service Providers (TPSPs) and all other contracted provider arrangements.  The intent is to ensure that the security of Mill Creek information and information assets are not reduced when exchanging information with third parties or by the introduction of third party products or services into the Mill Creek environment.


### Policy Scope
This Policy covers all Mill Creek TPSPs and all other contracted provider arrangements. All Mill Creek employees, including third parties and contractors, are required to comply with this Policy.

## Risk Management
Mill Creek shall manage and address the security risk of TPSPs that may have access to Mill Creek’s data or provide products or services to Mill Creek.


## Objectives

- Mill Creek will establish a Risk Assessment process to identify, measure, mitigate, and monitor risks to Mill Creek’s data, information systems, and Nonpublic Information (NPI) accessible to, or held by, third parties.
- Mill Creek will establish a due diligence process for prospective TPSPs, which addresses, at a minimum, a TPSP’s: 
- financial condition, 
- reputation,
- cybersecurity practices, 
- insurance coverage, 
- critical third parties, and
- strategic partners.
- Mill Creek will perform a periodic review of adherence to Service Level Agreements (SLAs), cybersecurity measures, and contractual and regulatory requirements.
- Mill Creek will maintain a current and accurate listing of all TPSPs and conduct a Risk Assessment of each one periodically.
- The Senior Officer of Mill Creek responsible for Mill Creek’s cybersecurity will inform senior management, and the Board of Directors if one exists, of the risks associated with outsourcing agreements to ensure effective risk management practices.

## Third Party Risk Assessment

- Mill Creek will establish a checklist or questionnaire to identify the risks of using a TPSP to determine if such third party’s practices could have a negative impact on Mill Creek.  Elements of a TPSP questionnaire should include the TPSP’s:
- Need to access NPI, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or Electronic Health Information (ePHI)
- Need to access financial or confidential data
- Need to access Mill Creek’s internal network
- Audit program or SSAE18 report
- Cybersecurity Program
- Vulnerability and penetration testing program
- Cybersecurity insurance or other related insurance
- Involvement in any recent cyberattack or data breach
- Compliance with federal and state laws and regulations 
- Mill Creek will review the checklist or questionnaire to evaluate and mitigate risks if possible and to decide whether to pursue the relationship with the third party.
- Mill Creek will conduct further due diligence to analyze whether the TPSP meets Mill Creek’s needs and regulatory requirements.


## Third Party Review

- Mill Creek will have a review program to ensure TPSPs are delivering the quantity and quality of services expected and/or agreed upon. 
- Mill Creek will monitor the key aspects of its relationships with third parties, including the security controls and financial strength of each third party, and the impact of any external events on its relationships with third parties.
Third Party Tracking 
- To increase monitoring effectiveness, Mill Creek periodically will rank TPSP relationships according to risk to determine which service providers require closer monitoring. 
- Mill Creek will base its rankings on the relationship’s residual risk after analyzing the quantity of risk relative to the controls over those risks.
- Relationships with third parties that Mill Creek has determined to be higher risk will receive more frequent and stringent monitoring of their performance (financial and/or operational), and more frequent independent control validation reviews.

## Third Party Service Reporting

- Mill Creek will monitor the service, reports, audits, and records provided by a TPSP and review them at intervals that will be based on their risk ranking.
- Mill Creek will conduct independent audits to ensure TPSPs are complying with their agreements and all requisite laws and regulations.
- Mill Creek will conduct regular meetings as required by SLAs and TPSP agreements to review reports, audit trails, security events, operational issues, failures, and disruptions, and will investigate and resolve identified issues.
- Mill Creek periodically will audit network connections with TPSPs to ensure that the connections are appropriate and meet all agreed upon requirements.
