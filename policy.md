## Purpose 

Securing and protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets is in the public's best interest to ensure the safety and security of critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions, and Nonpublic Information (NPI).
Failure to address the risks associated with cybersecurity could result in significant costs to Mill Creek Agency as a result of lost, compromised, or unauthorized use of NPI, legal and regulatory actions, and reputational damage and loss of customers, among other things. Cybersecurity Programs are critical to proactively protecting data, mitigating potential risks, and responding quickly and efficiently to cyber incidents, while maintaining compliance with best practice and regulatory requirements. 

The purpose of this Policy is to provide a framework for Mill Creek’s Cybersecurity Program, which is a documented set of information security policies, procedures, standards and guidelines.
(DFS’s Cybersecurity Regulation requires both a Cybersecurity Program (23 NYCRR 500.02) and a Cybersecurity Policy (23 NYCRR 500.03)).
Mill Creek's Cybersecurity Program shall provide a roadmap for effective security management practices and controls that protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Mill Creek’s Information Systems and information assets, including Nonpublic Information (NPI). 

This Policy will be based upon the findings of Mill Creek’s Risk Assessment and will address the following core cybersecurity functions:

- To protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information and related infrastructure assets.
- To manage the risk to Mill Creek of cybersecurity exposure and compromise.
- To assure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment at Mill Creek.
  - identify, respond to, and recover from events involving the misuse, loss, and/or unauthorized disclosure of Mill Creek’s information assets.
  - monitor Mill Creek’s information systems for anomalies that might indicate a compromise.
  - promote and increase awareness of information security at Mill Creek and to decrease the risk of cybersecurity exposure and compromise.
